 ### 1\.6 Debugging
 
-[...]
+It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the
+examples as you go. You can run most of the examples in interactive mode, but if you
+put the code in a script, it is easier to try out variations.
+
+Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes.
+For example, in the "Hello, world!" program, what happens if you leave out one of the
+quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell `print` wrong?
+
+This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps with
+debugging, because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make
+mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.
