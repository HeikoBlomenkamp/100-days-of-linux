+Python can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter
 displays an error message. **Syntax** refers to the structure of a program and the rules
 about that structure. In mathematical operations, for example, parentheses have to
 come in matching pairs; so `(4 + 5) * 10` is legal, but `8)` is a **syntax error**.
