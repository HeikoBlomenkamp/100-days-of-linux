## Preface

## 1\. The way of the program

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of
thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and
natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to
denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things,
assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives.
Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and
test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem solving**. Problem
solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and
express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to
program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why
this chapter is called, "The way of the program."

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level,
you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will
become clearer.



### 1\.1 The Lua programming language

The programming language you will learn is Lua. Lua is an example of a **high-level
language**; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Python,
and Java.

There are also **low-level languages**, sometimes referred to as "machine languages"
or "assembly languages." Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs
written in low-level languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to
be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a
small disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level
language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are
shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level
languages are **portable**, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers
with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of
computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages.
Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
**interpreters** and **compilers**. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes
it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a
time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. Figure 1.1 shows the
structure of an interpreter.

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts
running. In this context, the high-level program is called the **source code**, and the
translated program is called the **object code** or the **executable**. Once a program is
compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Figure 1.2 shows
the structure of a compiler.

**Figure 1.2**
: **A compiler translates source code into object code,
which is run by a hardware executor.**

Lua is considered an interpreted language because Lua programs are executed by an
interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: **interactive mode** and **script
mode**. In interactive mode, you type Lua programs and the interpreter displays the
result:

```
> 1 + 1
2
```

The chevron, `>` , is the **prompt** the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you
type `1 + 1` , the interpreter replies `2` .

Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to execute the
contents of the file, which is called a **script**. By convention, Lua scripts have names
that end with `.lua` .

To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the file. If you have
a script named `dinsdale.lua` and you are working in a \*NIX command window, you
type `lua dinsdale.lua` . In other development environments, the details of executing
scripts are different. You can find instructions for your environment at the Lua
website `http://lua.org` .

Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of code because
you can type and execute them immediately. But for anything more than a few lines,
you should save your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.



### 1\.2 What is a program?

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a
computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a
system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a
symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or
(strangely enough) compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear
in just about every language:

input:
: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.

output:
: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

math:
: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.

conditional execution:
: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.

repetition:
: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've ever used,
no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like
these. So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex
task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be
performed with one of these basic instructions.

That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic when we talk about
**algorithms**.



### 1\.3 What is debugging?

Programming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called
**bugs** and the process of tracking them down is called **debugging**.

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and
semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down
more quickly.



#### 1\.3\.1 Syntax errors

Lua can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter
displays an error message. **Syntax** refers to the structure of a program and the rules
about that structure. In mathematical operations, for example, parentheses have to
come in matching pairs; so `(4 + 5) * 10` is legal, but `8)` is a **syntax error**.

In English, readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the
poetry of e e cummings without spewing error messages. Lua is not so forgiving.
If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Lua will display an error
message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few
weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking
down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find
them faster.



#### 1\.3\.2 Runtime errors

The second type of error is a **runtime error**, so called because the error does not
appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called
**exceptions** because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has
happened. 

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters,
so it might be a while before you encounter one.



#### 1\.3\.3 Semantic errors

The third type of error is the **semantic error**. If there is a semantic error in your
program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any
error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else.
Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.

The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write.
The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors
can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of
the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.



#### 1\.3\.4 Experimental debugging

One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be
frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and
interesting parts of programming.

In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and
you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.

Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is
going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct,
then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a
working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new
one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out,

> "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
> remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
> ---A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four

For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is,
programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you
want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does *something* and
make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a
working program.

For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code,
but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386
chip. According to Larry Greenfield,

> "One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would
> switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved
> to Linux."
> ---The Linux Users' Guide, Beta Version 1

Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other
programming practices.
