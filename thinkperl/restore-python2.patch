 #### 1\.3\.1 Syntax errors
 
-Perl can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter
+Python can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter
 displays an error message. **Syntax** refers to the structure of a program and the rules
 about that structure. For example, parentheses (in mathematical operations) have to
 come in matching pairs, so `(4 + 5) * 10` is legal, but `8)` is a **syntax error**.
 
 In English, readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the
-poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Perl is not so forgiving.
-If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Perl will display an error
-message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few
-weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking
-down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find
-them faster.
